# Topical/Examples â†’ Todo

This is a todo list example. Each list is represented by an instance of the 'list' topic, and a separate 'lists' topic
maintains an index of the available lists.

State is persisted to files (as long as the topic is shut down cleanly).

# Running the example

```bash
iex -S mix
```

Open http://localhost:3000.
